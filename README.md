The Nova Act extension transforms how you build with [Amazon Nova Act](https://github.com/aws/nova-act) by bringing the entire agent development experience directly into IDEs like Visual Studio Code, Kiro, and Cursor. No more switching between tools or losing your train of thought‚Äîunify agent development, testing, and debugging into a single IDE environment designed for building reliable AI agents.

> Our extension uses your VS Code telemetry settings. If it is enabled, we collect only anonymous, aggregate telemetry data to help us improve the extension and provide a better experience. If you prefer, you can opt out at any time by following the [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/FAQ#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting) for VS Code, or the equivalent settings in Kiro and Cursor.

## Key Features

### Chat-to-Script Generation: Start With a Conversation

Describe your automation needs in natural language and get execution-ready agent scripts in minutes. Instead of starting from scratch with boilerplate code, simply tell the extension what you need.

For instance: "I need an agent that logs into a customer portal, searches for unresolved tickets, and updates their status based on completion criteria." The extension generates a functional script that handles authentication flow, navigation, search functionality, and status updates‚Äîgiving you a solid foundation to build on.

### Step-by-Step Builder: Build and Test Cell by Cell

Execute your script cell-by-cell with our notebook-style builder. Make a small change without running the entire script again. Focus on specific parts of your workflow‚Äîtesting different approaches, tweaking parameters, and validating results in real-time.

This modular approach means you can develop incrementally, adding cells, reordering them, and interleaving `act()` statements with regular Python code to build a robust agent one piece at a time.

### Live Debugging: Watch Your Agent Think and Act

Bring your code, browser view, and thinking and action logs into a single, cohesive experience within your IDE. Watch your agent execute while simultaneously monitoring its decision-making process‚Äîseeing exactly what it sees, why it makes each choice, and where things might go wrong.

Pause execution at any point to make adjustments, then resume testing without starting over. You can even multitask while the agent runs, editing code during execution and re-running cell by cell.

### Action Viewer: Review and Compare Workflow Versions

After your agent completes a run, examine everything that happened at whatever level of detail you need. Select "view your act run" for insights into a single act() statement or "view your session" to analyze the entire end-to-end workflow.

Compare multiple runs side-by-side as you iterate on your scripts. Easily spot improvements or regressions without manually sifting through separate HTML files or log outputs.

## Requirements

- IDE
  - VS Code >= 1.94.0
  - Latest version of Kiro
  - Latest version of Cursor
- Python version >= 3.10
- Operating System: MacOS Sierra+, Ubuntu 22.04+ or Windows 10+

- `/formfilling` - Automate form filling workflows
  - Sample: `@novaAct /formfilling Fill out the signup form on https://example.com/register with test user data`

## Setting Python Interpreter

The Nova Act extension relies on the [Nova Act SDK](https://github.com/aws/nova-act), which requires Python 3.10 or above. The extension will try to automatically detect a suitable Python interpreter.
If a valid Python interpreter cannot be found, you can set it up manually:

VS Code: Follow [VS Code Python environment setup](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments) to select your Python interpreter.

Kiro / Cursor: Follow the same procedure as VS Code to configure the Python interpreter.

### Verify Python Version

You can also check that your Python version is compatible by running:

`python --version` or `python3 --version`

Ensure the output shows Python 3.10 or above. If not, install or update Python before proceeding.

## Troubleshooting

### Port Usage

If you get a **StartFailed** error when running `nova.start()`, most likely there's a port conflict or you already have a running Nova Act client.

The Nova Act extension uses local ports `9222` (for Chrome DevTools) and `8001` (for internal communication). If these ports are already in use, Builder Mode may fail to start correctly.

#### Quick Fix

The **Restart Notebook** button (top right in Builder Mode) should clear port conflicts automatically and reset your extension state. If this fix does not work for you, proceed with the steps below:

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
lsof -i :9222
lsof -i :8001
kill -9 <PID>
```

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :9222
netstat -ano | findstr :8001
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```
