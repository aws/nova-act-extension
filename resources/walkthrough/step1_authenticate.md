# Authenticate: Choose Your Path

The Nova Act extension supports two authentication methods. Choose the one that fits your use case in the [Authenticate tab](command:nova-agent-vs-code-ext.showBuilderModeAuthenticate).

- **API Key** - Perfect for local development and testing. Visit [https://nova.amazon.com/act](https://nova.amazon.com/act) to get your API key, then [click here to set it](command:nova-agent-vs-code-ext.setApiKey).
- **AWS Credentials** - For deploying workflows to AWS and running them remotely. [Configure AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) via AWS CLI or environment variables.

**Tip:** Start with API Key to learn Nova Act, then switch to AWS Credentials when you're ready to deploy and run remote workflows.
